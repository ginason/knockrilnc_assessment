## Question
* How did you decide which technologies to use as part of your solution?

>All the technologies (programming language) that I decided to use as part of my solution was based on previous projects and self taught lessons. I am using Reactjs at work because reactjs is a very useful javascript framework for applications which has a faster web page load speed, code reusability, and SEO friendly.


* Are there any improvements you could make to your submission?

>The applications table of given JSON api does not include enough data to create comments value therefore I should create comments table and I changed comments of applications table from string to object. It makes you insert id and comment and retrieve comments in applications table. 


* What would you do differently if you were allocated more time?

>I would re-design JSON database structure for the comments API therefore, the user is able to add/edit/delete many comments under a video.
